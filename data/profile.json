      "description": "Built a complete Playwright framework from scratch to test the Automation Exercise website. This framework covers all major user workflows: from signing up and logging in to browsing products, completing purchases, and submitting contact forms. What makes this stand out is the professional setup - I configured it for cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari), parallel execution, and detailed HTML reports that show exactly what went wrong with screenshots and traces when tests fail. The structure is clean and maintainable, with each feature having its own dedicated test file.",

      "description": "Created a production-ready Cypress framework using the Page Object Model design pattern. This isn't just a bunch of tests thrown together - it's properly engineered with separate files for page locators and actions, making it easy to maintain as the application changes. I set up data-driven testing using JSON files, so test data is separate from test logic. The framework includes organized test suites for smoke, sanity, and regression testing, and it's CI/CD ready with GitHub Actions configured to run tests automatically on every code change.",
